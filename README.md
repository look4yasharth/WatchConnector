# Watch Connector
This watchOS application that I built helps user use this watchOS app to send and receive data from his/her iOS app. 

The watchOS app that I built is capable of performing the following five functions:

•	Transferring Real-Time Messages between Devices

•	Transferring Guaranteed Messages between Devices

•	Transferring Application State between Devices

•	Transferring Files between Devices

•	Updating a complication from the user’s phone   

In this project, I learnt to work with watchKit, watch interface controller, watch session delegate and foundation.
